# Cursor Change JS Project

This project demonstrates how to create a custom cursor effect using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The custom cursor replaces the default browser cursor with a styled cursor that changes appearance on hover and click events.

## Files

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that includes the structure of the webpage.
- `css/style.css`: The CSS file that contains styles for the custom cursor and other elements.
- `js/script.js`: The JavaScript file that handles the cursor movement and interaction logic.

## Features

- Custom cursor that follows the mouse movement.
- Cursor changes appearance when hovering over anchor tags.
- Cursor changes appearance on mouse click.

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser to see the custom cursor in action.
2. Move the mouse to see the cursor follow the movement.
3. Hover over the "Hover Me" link to see the cursor change.
4. Click anywhere on the page to see the cursor change on click.
